what is done:
- Instantiating buttons (elise) 
-
-



what needs to be done:
- Yesterday I had to stay on campus with my friend and got home very late, I will start working on this today and tomorrow. 9:22am Sept 24th -Medina


- Visual display of numbers on the screen when buttons are clicked


Logic we need to implement 
- Ensure that it accounts for the order of operations (e.g. when 2+2x6 is keyed, pressing '=' should show 14 instead of 24) This also needs to account for decimal. --> Elise 

- Ensure that we throw error when answer is undeined/ when user keys in wrongly (e.g. 2+-4) --> Let's just display "Err" as error message on the text display
